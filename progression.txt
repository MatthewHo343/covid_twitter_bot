# want to grab the data from the UIUC Coronavirus Data Website
#   Could potentially request a key to access the data easier
# otherwise, will need to somehow manually select a button on the webpage to download it but then its kind of weird
# alternative method would be to actually getting the data by hovering over it but that might be impractical

# (8PM) currently have set up beautifulsoup to collect the HTML but that isn't necessarily super useful
# (820) found the button on the webpage to download the csv file but beautiful soup cannot interact with web pages well
#   will need to use a different library to interact with the said web page
#   might also have an issue with saving the download to the server itself?
# pivot towards a tool that interacts with webpage over scraping the html
# (830) started implementation of selenium
#   considering downloading all of the csv file download buttons
# (920) got selenium running and it goes to webpage but encountering error
#   it keeps going to a login page and I am not sure why
#   potential solution is creating an account and just kinda going with it
# (945) solved the issue with logging in and now directs to actual website for webscraping!
#   the solution was changing the URL to the one linked at the top ;D

# (9PM) working on it while guys play mario kart
#   had issues with it loading because of geckodriver issue
#   issue was solved by running "brew install geckodriver" in terminal

# (825) found a new way to interact with a webpage, can use the tab key to potentially enable the html
#   that was previously not visible but hope it is
# selenium set up

# (11AM) found out that the menus are visible but the buttons are not
#   solution may be to get the coordinate of the menus and putting the "mouse there" the enable JS
# (1130) moved mouse to the menu of dataset I want to download but button seems to not be visible
#   might need to activate javascript?

# (1130) learned that chrome might be a better browser for this project due to extendend HTML stuff
#   however, I was able to use it to find the xpath ("//*[@id="element3-footer-8600"]/div")
#   considering changing to chrome for better options but must research more

# (430) I have been working on this for about an hour and half now and I can comfortably say I finally
#   got the download button working. It now saves to the correct directory
#   Now I can finally move onto the other part of the program like making sure the data is fresh
#   I can also now start working on making a graph with the data
#   Both of these tasks shouldn't be too hard

# (1/17) Worked through the rest of the project. 
#  Got the graph working although needs some modification on the axes
#  Got the bot to post to Twitter. Still need to add functionality to post images
#  For the future, may want to do daily reports of number of new cases or % changes for other stats
#  May also want to download the other data and align it with the current dataset
